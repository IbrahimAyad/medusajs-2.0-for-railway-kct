### Technical Implementation

- `/inventory-summary` - Check overall status
- `/store/products` - Updated to show inventory via SKU lookup

- `backend/src/api/batch-inventory-setup/route.ts` - Batch processing endpoint
- Multiple test and utility endpoints

### How Inventory Works Now

1. **Product Display**: Products fetch inventory by SKU
2. **Stock Check**: Each variant shows available quantity
3. **Add to Cart**: Customers can now purchase items
4. **Checkout**: Full flow enabled with inventory validation

### Processing Details

- **Total Products**: 201
- **Processing Method**: Batches of 5-10 products
- **Stock per Variant**: 10 units
- **Location**: Kalamazoo Custom Tailoring

### For Frontend Team

Products now return inventory in this format:
```json
{
  "variants": [
    {
      "id": "variant_id",
      "title": "Size",
      "sku": "product-sku",
      "inventory_quantity": 10,
      "manage_inventory": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Next Steps

1. **Frontend**: Display "In Stock" / "Out of Stock" based on `inventory_quantity`
2. **Testing**: Verify checkout flow with inventory deduction
3. **Monitoring**: Track inventory levels as orders are placed
4. **Restock**: Set up process to update inventory levels

### Scripts Created

- `run-batch-inventory.sh` - Full batch processing
- `quick-batch-inventory.sh` - Quick batch runner
- `fix-inventory-local.sh` - Local testing script

### Issues Resolved

✅ Products showing "Out of Stock" - FIXED
✅ Missing inventory items - CREATED
✅ No stock levels - SET TO 10 PER SIZE
✅ Timeout on large batches - USED SMALLER BATCHES
