# üö® CRITICAL: STRIPE OVERCHARGING FIX DEPLOYED

## Emergency Fix - September 9, 2025

### THE PROBLEM (CRITICAL)
- **Bug**: Customers were charged 100x the intended amount
- **Example**: $52.99 charged as $5,299.00
- **Cause**: Double multiplication of amounts already in cents

### THE FIX ‚úÖ
Fixed in `/backend/src/api/store/checkout/route.ts`:

**BEFORE (BUG):**
```javascript
amount: total * 100  // WRONG! total is already in cents
```

**AFTER (FIXED):**
```javascript
amount: total  // Correct - already in cents, no multiplication needed
```

### DEPLOYMENT STATUS
- ‚úÖ Fix implemented in code
- ‚úÖ Deployed to Railway at 01:52 UTC
- üîÑ Build URL: https://railway.com/project/d0792b49-f30a-4c02-b8ab-01a202f9df4e/service/2f6e09b8-3ec3-4c98-ab98-2b5c2993fa7a

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
1. **Medusa stores all amounts in cents** (smallest currency unit)
2. **Stripe also expects amounts in cents**
3. **The bug**: Code was multiplying by 100 again, thinking it needed to convert dollars to cents
4. **Result**: 5299 cents (correct) ‚Üí 529900 cents (100x overcharge)

### AFFECTED TRANSACTIONS
From Stripe dashboard:
- $5,009.00 charged (should have been $50.09)
- $10.00 charged (should have been $0.10)
- Multiple canceled/incomplete transactions

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
1. ‚úÖ Emergency fix deployed
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE REFUNDS** for overcharged transactions
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **TEST** with small amount before processing real orders
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **MONITOR** new transactions closely

### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create a test cart with known amount (e.g., $1.00)
2. Process payment
3. Verify Stripe charges exactly $1.00 (not $100.00)

### PREVENTION
- Always remember: **Medusa amounts are already in cents**
- Never multiply Medusa amounts by 100 for Stripe
- Add unit tests for payment amounts
- Add monitoring alerts for unusual charge amounts

### FILES MODIFIED
- `/backend/src/api/store/checkout/route.ts` (Lines 84-85, 96-97)

### DEPLOYMENT COMMAND
```bash
cd backend && railway up --service Backend
```
