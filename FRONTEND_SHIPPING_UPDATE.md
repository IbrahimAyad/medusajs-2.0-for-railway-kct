# ðŸ“¢ FRONTEND TEAM UPDATE - Shipping Methods Fixed!

## âœ… BACKEND FIXES DEPLOYED

We've fixed the shipping methods endpoint that was causing 500 errors. Here's what you need to know:

## ðŸš€ Deployment Status
- **Build ID**: 0f305daa-24cf-4989-8b22-8afd6f7994fa  
- **ETA**: 5-10 minutes for full deployment

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### Problem
The `/store/carts/{id}/shipping-methods` endpoint was returning fake success but not actually saving the shipping method, causing "No shipping method selected" errors during checkout.

### Solution
Now properly saves shipping methods to the database using Medusa's workflow system.

## ðŸ“‹ No Frontend Changes Needed!

The API format remains the same:

```javascript
// 1. Get available shipping options
GET /store/carts/{cart_id}/shipping-options

// Response:
{
  "shipping_options": [{
    "id": "so_free_shipping",
    "name": "Free Shipping",
    "price": 0
  }]
}

// 2. Select a shipping method
POST /store/carts/{cart_id}/shipping-methods
{
  "option_id": "so_free_shipping"
}

// Response (NOW WITH REAL DATA):
{
  "cart": {
    "id": "cart_xxx",
    "shipping_methods": [{
      "id": "sm_xxx",
      "shipping_option": {
        "id": "so_free_shipping",
        "name": "Free Shipping",
        "price": 0
      }
    }],
    "shipping_total": 0
  }
}
```

## âœ… What Works Now

1. **Shipping method is actually saved** to the database
2. **Checkout completion** won't fail with "No shipping method selected"
3. **Cart response** includes real shipping_methods array
4. **Orders can be created** successfully

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

Once deployment completes (5-10 mins):

1. Clear browser cache/storage
2. Create new cart
3. Add Mint Vest Size S ($1.00)
4. Enter shipping address
5. **Select shipping method** - Should return cart with shipping_methods array
6. Create payment session
7. Process payment with Stripe
8. Complete cart at `/store/carts/{cart_id}/complete`
9. **Order should be created successfully!**

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

**No code changes needed on frontend!** The endpoint now actually works as it was supposed to. The shipping method will be properly saved and checkout should complete without errors.

## ðŸ“Š Expected Behavior

- âœ… Shipping method persists in database
- âœ… Cart completion succeeds
- âœ… Order is created
- âœ… No more "No shipping method selected" errors

**Backend is ready!** Test the full checkout flow once deployment completes.
