## 📝 CURRENT APPROACH FOR 100X FIX

Since the custom module had TypeScript issues, we're now using:

1. **Standard Stripe Provider** with optimized configuration
2. **Payment Hooks** for logging and monitoring amounts
3. **Authorize-Payment Endpoint** that properly handles frontend data

## 🧪 READY TO TEST

Once deployment completes:

1. **Test Product**: Mint Vest Size S at $1.00
2. **Expected Charge**: $1.00 (not $100.00)
3. **Order Creation**: Should appear in admin

## 📊 MONITORING

Check logs with:
```bash
railway logs --service Backend | grep "STRIPE AMOUNT FIX"
```

This will show the actual amounts being processed.

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ TypeScript errors fixed
2. ✅ Deployment in progress
3. ⏳ Wait for deployment to complete
4. 🧪 Test $1.00 purchase
5. 📊 Verify correct amount charged
6. 📦 Confirm order in admin
