# Railway Health Check Fix - September 2025

## Problem
Railway deployment health checks were failing with "service unavailable" errors even though the Medusa server was starting successfully on port 8080.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Health Endpoint**: Railway was checking `/health` endpoint which didn't exist in the Medusa application
2. **The server WAS actually running** successfully on the correct port (8080), but Railway couldn't verify it

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Health Check Endpoint
Created `/backend/src/api/health/route.ts`:
```typescript
import type { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from "@medusajs/framework/http"

export const GET = async (
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) => {
  res.json({
    status: "ok",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
}
```

### 2. Simplified Start Script
Updated `/backend/start.sh` to be cleaner and more reliable:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "=== STARTING RAILWAY BACKEND DEPLOYMENT ==="
echo "NODE_ENV: $NODE_ENV"
echo "PORT: ${PORT:-NOT SET}"

# Run init-backend script first
if [ -f "src/scripts/init-backend.js" ]; then
    echo "Running init-backend script..."
    node src/scripts/init-backend.js || echo "WARNING: init-backend.js had issues"
fi

# Change to .medusa/server directory
cd .medusa/server

# Start Medusa - it will use the PORT environment variable automatically
echo "Starting Medusa on port ${PORT:-8080}..."
exec npx medusa start
```

### 3. Railway Configuration
Added `/backend/railway.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3
  }
}
```

## Key Insights
- The server was actually working all along - it was serving requests successfully
- The logs showed: `Server is ready on port: 8080`
- Railway just couldn't verify the health because the endpoint was missing
- Medusa automatically uses the `PORT` environment variable (no need to explicitly export it)

## Verification
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://backend-production-7441.up.railway.app/health
# Returns: OK (200)

# Test API endpoint
curl https://backend-production-7441.up.railway.app/store/customers/me
# Returns: 400 (expected - needs auth headers)
```

## Deployment Command
Always deploy from the parent directory:
```bash
cd /Users/ibrahim/Desktop/medusa-railway-setup
railway up --service Backend
```

## Status
✅ Backend is now deployed and running successfully
✅ Health checks are passing
✅ API endpoints are responding correctly
