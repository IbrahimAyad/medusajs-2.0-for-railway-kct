# üöÄ Manual Railway Deployment Instructions

## Your Stripe Tax implementation is ready to deploy!

### Option 1: Deploy via Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Open Railway Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Open your `admin-kct` project

2. **Find Your Backend Service**
   - Look for the service running your Medusa backend
   - It should show as connected to GitHub

3. **Trigger Redeploy**
   - Click on the service
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" button
   - Or go to "Deployments" tab and click "Trigger Deploy"

### Option 2: Deploy via Terminal (Interactive)

```bash
# From this directory, run:
cd backend
railway link  # Choose admin-kct project
railway service  # Select your backend service
railway up  # Deploy the code
```

### Option 3: Push to GitHub (If secrets are removed)

The Stripe Tax code is already committed locally. To push to GitHub:

1. First, remove the files with secrets:
```bash
git rm RAILWAY_ENV_VARIABLES.env RAILWAY_ENV_CHECKLIST.md
git commit -m "Remove files with secrets"
```

2. Then push to your fork:
```bash
git push myfork master
```

Railway will auto-deploy from GitHub.
