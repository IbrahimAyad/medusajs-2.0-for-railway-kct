# Shipping Options for KCT Menswear on Medusa 2.0

## Current Status (August 2024)
Medusa 2.0 is newly released and most v1.x shipping providers haven't been ported yet.

## Available Options:

### 1. Use Manual Fulfillment (Immediate)
- Set fixed shipping rates by region/weight
- Manually process orders and add tracking numbers
- Good for starting out with predictable shipping costs

Example rates for suits/formal wear:
```
Standard Shipping (5-7 days): $12.99
Express Shipping (2-3 days): $24.99
Free Shipping: Orders over $200
```

### 2. Wait for Official Providers (3-6 months)
EasyPost, Shippo, and ShipStation integrations are likely coming but not available yet.

### 3. Build Custom Integration (1-2 weeks dev time)
Create a custom fulfillment provider using:
- EasyPost API (recommended - best US carrier coverage)
- Individual carrier APIs (FedEx, UPS, USPS)

## Custom EasyPost Integration Example:

```typescript
// src/modules/fulfillment-easypost/service.ts
import { IFulfillmentProvider } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import EasyPost from "@easypost/api"

export class EasyPostFulfillmentService implements IFulfillmentProvider {
  private client: EasyPost
  
  constructor() {
    this.client = new EasyPost(process.env.EASYPOST_API_KEY)
  }
  
  async calculatePrice(data) {
    // Get real-time rates from EasyPost
    const shipment = await this.client.Shipment.create({
      to_address: data.shipping_address,
      from_address: data.from_address,
      parcel: data.parcel
    })
    
    return shipment.rates
  }
  
  async createFulfillment(data) {
    // Create shipping label
    const shipment = await this.client.Shipment.buy(
      data.shipment_id, 
      data.rate
    )
    
    return {
      tracking_number: shipment.tracking_code,
      label_url: shipment.postage_label.label_url
    }
  }
}
```

## Recommendation for KCT:

**Start with Manual Fulfillment** and fixed rates:
1. Most suit retailers use standard shipping rates anyway
2. Suits have predictable weights (2-3 lbs)
3. You can upgrade to real-time rates later

**Set these rates in admin panel:**
- US Standard: $12.99 (or free over $200)
- US Express: $24.99
- Canada: $19.99
- International: $39.99

This approach lets you launch immediately while waiting for official providers or building a custom integration later.
