# KCT Menswear Auth System Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Frontend Auth System
1. **Auth Store (Zustand)**
   - Created complete auth store with JWT token management
   - Implemented login, register, logout, and checkAuth methods
   - Added persistent storage with localStorage
   - Integrated with Medusa 2.0 SDK

2. **Auth Pages**
   - ‚úÖ Login page: https://kct-menswear-medusa-test.vercel.app/auth/login
   - ‚úÖ Signup page: https://kct-menswear-medusa-test.vercel.app/auth/signup
   - Both pages have proper form validation and error handling

3. **Account Management**
   - ‚úÖ Account dashboard: https://kct-menswear-medusa-test.vercel.app/account
   - ‚úÖ Order history page: https://kct-menswear-medusa-test.vercel.app/account/orders
   - ‚úÖ UserMenu component with login/logout functionality

4. **UI Components**
   - Created Alert component for error messages
   - All components use shadcn/ui for consistent styling

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Backend Auth Issues
1. **Customer API Endpoints**
   - `/store/customers/me` returns 401 Unauthorized even with valid token
   - This appears to be a backend configuration issue
   - Workaround: Auth system stores user data from initial login

2. **Token Authentication**
   - Tokens are successfully generated and stored
   - But customer retrieval after login fails with "Unauthorized"
   - This doesn't affect basic login/logout functionality

### What Works
- ‚úÖ User can create an account
- ‚úÖ User can log in
- ‚úÖ Token is stored and persisted
- ‚úÖ User can log out
- ‚úÖ UI shows logged in state
- ‚úÖ Cart can be created with guest checkout

### What Needs Backend Support
- ‚ùå Fetching customer profile after login
- ‚ùå Updating customer profile
- ‚ùå Associating orders with customer accounts
- ‚ùå Protected routes that verify token validity

## üîß Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Backend Configuration**
   - Enable customer endpoints in Medusa backend
   - Configure proper JWT authentication
   - Ensure publishable key is properly configured

2. **Order Association**
   - Link orders to customer accounts
   - Show order history for logged-in users
   - Allow customers to track their orders

3. **Checkout Integration**
   - Connect auth system with checkout flow
   - Pre-fill customer information
   - Save addresses to customer profile

### Testing Instructions
1. Visit: https://kct-menswear-medusa-test.vercel.app/auth/signup
2. Create a test account
3. Log in with your credentials
4. Navigate to account dashboard
5. Note: Order history will be empty until backend integration is complete

## üìù Technical Notes

### Auth Flow
```
1. User enters email/password
2. Frontend calls medusa.auth.login()
3. Backend returns JWT token
4. Token stored in localStorage
5. Token set in Medusa SDK client
6. User marked as authenticated in UI
```

### Token Management
- Token stored in: `localStorage.medusa_token`
- Auth state stored in: `localStorage.kct-auth-storage`
- Token included in API calls via: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL=https://backend-production-7441.up.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_4c24b336db3f8819867bec16f4b51db9654e557abbcfbbe003f7ffd8463c3c81
```

## Summary

The auth system frontend is fully implemented and deployed. Users can now:
- Create accounts
- Log in and out
- View their account dashboard
- Navigate to order history (though orders won't show without backend support)

The main limitation is that the backend customer endpoints return unauthorized errors, preventing full profile management and order association. This needs to be addressed in the backend configuration.
