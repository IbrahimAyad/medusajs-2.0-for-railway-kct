## 📊 System Architecture

```
Frontend (Vercel)
    ↓
Backend (Railway) ← You are here
    ↓
Database (Railway PostgreSQL)
    ↓
Stripe (Manual Capture Mode)
```

## 🔧 Key Configuration

- **Stripe Mode**: Manual capture
- **Amount Handling**: Direct pass-through (no multiplication)
- **Shipping**: FREE by default
- **Provider ID**: `stripe` (not `pp_stripe_stripe`)

## ⚠️ Known Edge Cases

1. **Shipping Method Required**: Cart must have shipping method selected
2. **Payment Authorization**: Some flows may require explicit authorization
3. **Already Captured**: Backend handles if Stripe already captured

## 📝 Summary

**ALL BACKEND FIXES DEPLOYED AND LIVE**

The system is ready for end-to-end testing. The 100x overcharging bug is fixed, orders should be created properly, and all required endpoints are in place.
