# Security Notice

## Potentially Exposed Information
During the debugging process, some sensitive information may have been exposed in the git history:

### What was exposed:
1. **Default fallback password**: "127598" (used as fallback in scripts)
2. **Database structure**: User IDs and auth identity IDs (now removed)
3. **Redis and Database URLs**: These were in logs but are Railway-specific internal URLs

### Actions Taken:
1. ✅ Removed debug endpoints containing hardcoded IDs
2. ✅ Added comprehensive .gitignore file
3. ✅ Updated .env.template to use placeholder values
4. ✅ Removed sensitive SQL files

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Change your admin password immediately** in the Railway dashboard environment variables
2. **Rotate your JWT_SECRET and COOKIE_SECRET** in Railway
3. **Review Railway access logs** for any unauthorized access attempts
4. **Consider rotating database credentials** if you suspect any compromise

### For Production Deployment:
1. Never use default passwords
2. Always use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Generate secure random strings for secrets:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
4. Use Railway's secret management for sensitive values
5. Enable 2FA on your GitHub and Railway accounts

### Git History Cleanup (Optional):
If you want to completely remove sensitive data from git history:
```bash
# Use git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner
# Warning: This will rewrite history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch backend/src/api/link-auth/route.ts" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

## Security Best Practices Going Forward:
1. Always use .env files for local development
2. Never commit .env files
3. Use .env.template with placeholder values
4. Review code for sensitive data before committing
5. Use Railway's environment variable management
6. Regularly rotate secrets and passwords
7. Monitor access logs for suspicious activity
