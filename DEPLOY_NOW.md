# ðŸš€ DEPLOY STRIPE TAX TO RAILWAY - SIMPLE STEPS

## The Stripe Tax code is ready in your backend folder!

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (EASIEST - 2 clicks)

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your **admin-kct** project â†’ Click on your backend service
3. Click **"Redeploy"** button (in Settings tab)

That's it! Railway will rebuild and deploy with the new Stripe Tax code.

### Option 2: Terminal Interactive Mode

Since we have multiple services, you need to select interactively:

```bash
# Run this command (you're already in backend folder):
railway service
```

When prompted:
1. Select your backend service (likely option 2 or 3)
2. Then run:
```bash
railway up
```

### What's Been Added:
âœ… Stripe Tax provider in `backend/src/modules/stripe-tax/`
âœ… Configuration in `backend/medusa-config.js`
âœ… Automatic tax calculation for US and international orders

### After Deployment:
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Products â†’ Tax â†’ Activate
2. Add tax registrations for states where you collect tax
3. Test with a US address - tax will calculate automatically!

The code is already in your backend folder - just needs to be deployed!
