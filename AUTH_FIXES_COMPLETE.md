# KCT Menswear Auth System - Issues Fixed ✅

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### 1. ✅ CORS Configuration Issue
**Problem**: Backend was rejecting requests from `https://kct-menswear-medusa-test.vercel.app`
- Error: "Origin not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin"

**Solution**: Updated Railway environment variables:
- Added Vercel domain to `STORE_CORS`
- Added Vercel domain to `AUTH_CORS`
- Added Vercel domain to `ADMIN_CORS`
- Redeployed backend via `railway up --service Backend`

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Auth endpoints are now accessible

### 2. ✅ Checkbox State Binding Issue
**Problem**: Terms checkbox wasn't updating state properly
- Checkbox appeared checked visually but state remained false
- Create Account button stayed disabled

**Solution**: Fixed the onCheckedChange handler:
```typescript
// Before (broken):
onCheckedChange={(checked) => setAcceptTerms(checked as boolean)}

// After (fixed):
onCheckedChange={(checked) => setAcceptTerms(checked === true)}
```

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Checkbox now properly enables Create Account button
