# üéØ Breaking the Circle - Coordination Plan

## Current Status
‚úÖ Supabase is working (you showed query results with products)
‚ùå But the API endpoint still shows permission denied
üîÑ We're in the circular problem again

## The Real Issue
The problem is we have different Supabase instances or the server is caching the old connection.

## Immediate Action Plan

### 1. For Main Project (This Claude):
```bash
# Kill the current server
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running npm run dev

# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart the server
npm run dev
```

Then test: http://localhost:3000/api/test-supabase

### 2. For Backend Project (Cursor Claude):

**CRITICAL**: Make sure BOTH projects use the EXACT SAME Supabase instance!

Tell the Backend Claude:
```
STOP - Don't create new Supabase connections. 
1. Use the SAME Supabase URL and keys as the main project
2. Copy the working supabase-products.ts file EXACTLY
3. Just change process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC to import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC
```

### 3. Test Sequence:

1. **Main Project Test**:
   - http://localhost:3000/api/test-supabase
   - Should show products

2. **Backend Project Test**:
   - Create similar test endpoint
   - Should show SAME products

### 4. If Still Having Issues:

The shared service pattern only works if:
- ‚úÖ Same Supabase instance
- ‚úÖ Same table structure
- ‚úÖ Same RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Same credentials

## Breaking the Circle

Instead of fixing one then the other breaks, we need to:
1. Get BOTH projects reading from Supabase first
2. THEN worry about writing/updating
3. Use the shared service for ALL operations

## Next Message to Backend Claude:
"The main project can now read from Supabase. Copy the exact supabase-products.ts file but change the env vars to use import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC instead of process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC. Test reading products first before doing anything else."
