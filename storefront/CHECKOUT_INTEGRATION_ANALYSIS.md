## üìä CONFIGURATION COMPARISON

### Supabase URLs (MISMATCH FOUND!)

| Item | Admin Panel Says | Your Current Config | Status |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Supabase URL** | `https://fkrzauubsrumcmnbcqkv.supabase.co` | `https://gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz.supabase.co` | ‚ùå **DIFFERENT** |
| **Anon Key** | `eyJhb...` (starts with fkrz) | `eyJhb...` (starts with gvcs) | ‚ùå **DIFFERENT** |
| **Stripe Public** | `pk_live_51RAMT2...` | `pk_live_51RAMT2...` | ‚úÖ MATCHES |

### üö® CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND
**You're using a DIFFERENT Supabase instance than the admin panel!**

---

## üîÑ WHAT THIS MEANS

### Current Situation:
1. **Admin Panel Database:** `fkrzauubsrumcmnbcqkv.supabase.co`
   - Contains 183 catalog products
   - Has orders, customers, inventory tables
   - Connected to admin dashboard

2. **Your Website Database:** `gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz.supabase.co`
   - Different database entirely
   - May not have the same tables/products
   - Orders won't appear in admin panel

### Impact:
- ‚ùå Orders placed on website won't show in admin panel
- ‚ùå Inventory updates from admin won't reflect on website
- ‚ùå Customer data stored in wrong database
- ‚ùå Product catalog might be different
- ‚úÖ Stripe payments will still work (same account)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Option 1: Switch to Admin Panel Database (RECOMMENDED)
```env
# Update your .env.local file:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://fkrzauubsrumcmnbcqkv.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImZrcnphdXVic3J1bWNtbmJjcWt2Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MzM5NTM3MzIsImV4cCI6MjA0OTUyOTczMn0.P7MmQ9EC4O-1OF-Q0Ss8K6xGqsx5Ynn6hqUwZGGvNRo

# You'll also need the service role key (ask admin for this)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[Need from admin]
```

### Option 2: Keep Current Database
- Orders won't sync with admin panel
- Need manual process to transfer data
- Admin features won't work

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S ALREADY CORRECT

### Working Components:
1. **Stripe Integration** ‚úÖ
   - Same Stripe account
   - Public key matches
   - Payments will process correctly

2. **Checkout Flow** ‚úÖ
   - `/api/stripe/checkout` endpoint exists
   - Cart functionality works
   - Redirect to Stripe works

3. **Core Structure** ‚úÖ
   - useCart hook exists
   - Product display works
   - Cart persistence implemented

---

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### To Integrate with Admin Panel:

#### 1. Database Connection
- [ ] Update Supabase URL to admin panel database
- [ ] Update Supabase anon key
- [ ] Get service role key from admin
- [ ] Test connection to new database

#### 2. Verify Tables Exist
```sql
-- Check these tables exist in admin database:
- products
- product_variants
- product_images
- orders
- order_items
- customers
- inventory_logs
```

#### 3. Update Product Fetching
```javascript
// Your current products might be from Stripe
// Need to fetch from Supabase instead:

// From admin panel database
const { data: products } = await supabase
  .from('products')
  .select('*, product_variants(*), product_images(*)')
  .eq('status', 'active');
```

#### 4. Hybrid Checkout Support
The admin panel supports two product types:
1. **Core Products**: 28 Stripe products (what you have now)
2. **Catalog Products**: Database products (183 in admin)

Your checkout needs to handle both:
```javascript
// Core product (Stripe)
{
  type: 'core',
  stripe_price_id: 'price_xxx',
  quantity: 1
}

// Catalog product (Supabase)
{
  type: 'catalog',
  variant_id: 'var_xxx',
  product_id: 'prod_xxx',
  quantity: 1
}
```

#### 5. Edge Function Integration
- [ ] Create `create-checkout-secure` Edge Function
- [ ] Deploy to Supabase
- [ ] Handle mixed cart (core + catalog)

---

## üö¶ TESTING PLAN

### Phase 1: Database Switch
1. Backup current data if needed
2. Update environment variables
3. Test connection to admin database
4. Verify products load

### Phase 2: Checkout Testing
1. Add core product to cart
2. Add catalog product to cart
3. Process test checkout
4. Verify order appears in admin panel

### Phase 3: Go Live
1. Switch to production mode
2. Process real order
3. Verify in admin dashboard
4. Check inventory updates

---

## üí° RECOMMENDATION

### For V1 Launch:
1. **SWITCH TO ADMIN DATABASE NOW**
   - Orders will sync with admin panel
   - Inventory management works
   - Customer data captured correctly
   - Admin can see everything

2. **Keep Current Stripe Products**
   - Your 28 core products work fine
   - Can add database products later
   - Hybrid checkout supports both

3. **Test Before Launch**
   - Use Stripe test mode first
   - Verify orders appear in admin
   - Check email notifications
   - Test inventory updates

---

## üîê SECURITY NOTES

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Using publishable Stripe key (correct)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Service role key exposed in .env.local (should be server-only)
- ‚úÖ Not exposing Stripe secret key to frontend

### Recommendations:
1. Move service role key to `.env` (not `.env.local`)
2. Only use in API routes/Edge Functions
3. Never expose to client-side code

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Decide on database** (admin panel vs current)
2. **Update environment variables** if switching
3. **Test product loading** from correct database
4. **Verify checkout flow** with test purchase

### Questions for Admin:
1. Is `fkrzauubsrumcmnbcqkv` the correct production database?
2. Can you provide the service role key?
3. Are the 183 products ready for the website?
4. Should we use Edge Functions or API routes?

---

## üéØ SUMMARY

**Critical Finding:** You're using a different Supabase database than your admin panel.

**Impact:** Orders won't sync, inventory won't update, admin can't see data.

**Solution:** Switch to admin panel database (`fkrzauubsrumcmnbcqkv`) before launch.

**Timeline:** Can be fixed in 30 minutes with correct credentials.
