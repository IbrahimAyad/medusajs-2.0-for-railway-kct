### Explicit Invocation
You can explicitly request an agent's help:
"Using the Performance Optimizer agent, analyze our current bundle size and suggest optimizations"

### Cross-Project Collaboration
These frontend agents work together with the backend agents:
- Frontend Developer ↔️ Database Admin (for API integration)
- Security Auditor ↔️ SQL Pro (for secure queries)
- Analytics Engineer ↔️ Database Optimizer (for performance)

## Next Steps

1. **Test Agent Integration**: Try invoking different agents for specific tasks
2. **Customize as Needed**: Modify agents based on project requirements
3. **Add More Agents**: Create additional specialized agents as needs arise
