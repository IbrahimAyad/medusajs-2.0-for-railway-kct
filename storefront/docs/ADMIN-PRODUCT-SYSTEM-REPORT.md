### 2. Database Structure

**Supabase Tables:**

- `product_options` - Cached Stripe product data

**Analytics Views:**
- `order_analytics` - Daily revenue and order metrics

### 3. Order Flow

1. **Customer Selection** → Product page with size/color options
2. **Add to Cart** → Local storage + session management
3. **Checkout** → Stripe Checkout Session with metadata
4. **Payment** → Stripe processes payment
5. **Webhook** → Supabase Edge Function creates order
6. **Confirmation** → Customer receives email + order tracking

## 📈 Bundle Performance Insights

### Working Bundle Strategy

All 66 bundles use **shared Stripe Price IDs** from core products:

| Price Point | Stripe Price ID | Used By | Bundle Count |
|------------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| $199.99 | `price_1RpvZUCHc12x7sCzM4sp9DY5` | Casual, Summer | 23 bundles |
| $229.99 | `price_1RpvZtCHc12x7sCzny7VmEWD` | Original, Wedding | 28 bundles |
| $249.99 | `price_1RpvaBCHc12x7sCzRV6Hy0Im` | Prom, Executive | 15 bundles |

**Note:** While functional, creating unique Stripe Products for each bundle would improve tracking granularity.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Current Limitations:

1. **Shared Price IDs** - Bundles use core product IDs (works but limits individual tracking)
2. **Image Hosting** - Multiple R2 buckets (consolidation recommended)
3. **Email System** - SendGrid needs configuration for order confirmations
4. **Admin Panel** - Currently shows mock data (can be connected to real analytics)

### Recommended Improvements (Post-Launch):

1. Create unique Stripe Products for each bundle (better analytics)
2. Consolidate images to single R2 bucket
3. Connect admin dashboard to real Supabase data
4. Configure SendGrid for transactional emails
5. Implement inventory tracking for sizes

## 📊 Admin Dashboard Access

### Current Pages:
- **Orders:** `/orders` - Customer order history (Supabase connected)
- **Admin Panel:** `/admin` - Overview dashboard (currently mock data)
- **Products:** `/products` - Full product catalog
- **Bundles:** `/bundles` - Bundle showcase

### To View Sales Data:

Access Supabase Dashboard and run:

```sql
-- View all orders
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View bundle sales
SELECT 
  items->>'productName' as product,
  COUNT(*) as sales,
  SUM(amount_total) as revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'paid'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- Daily revenue
SELECT * FROM order_analytics;
```
