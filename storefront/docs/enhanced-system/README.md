curl -X POST "https://kct-menswear-v2.vercel.app/api/products/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"search_term": "navy suit", "include_legacy": true, "include_enhanced": true}'
```

### Database Validation
```sql
-- Verify enhanced products tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name LIKE '%enhanced%';

-- Test enhanced products functionality
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_enhanced FROM products_enhanced WHERE status = 'active';
```

### Frontend Testing
```typescript
// Test enhanced product component
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { EnhancedProductCard } from '@/components/products/enhanced/EnhancedProductCard';

test('renders enhanced product card', () => {
  render(<EnhancedProductCard product={mockEnhancedProduct} />);
  expect(screen.getByText(mockEnhancedProduct.name)).toBeInTheDocument();
