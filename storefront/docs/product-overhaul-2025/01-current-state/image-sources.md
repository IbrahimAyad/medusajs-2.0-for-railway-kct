**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** January 14, 2025  
**Status:** Current State Analysis

## Executive Summary

KCT Menswear currently operates a **fragmented image architecture** across multiple CDN sources, creating performance bottlenecks and management complexity. This document catalogs all image sources and provides a roadmap for consolidation.

## 🖼️ Current Image Sources

### Primary R2 Bucket (Core Products)
**URL**: `pub-46371bda6faf4910b74631159fc2dfd4.r2.dev`  
**Status**: ✅ Active and Stable  
**Products Served**: Core Stripe Products (28 suits)  

```
Structure:
/kct-products/
├── suits/
│   ├── navy/[front|back|side].jpg
│   ├── black/[front|back|side].jpg
│   └── [14 colors total]
└── metadata.json
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- Load Time: 1.2s average
- Success Rate: 99.5%
- File Sizes: 200-800KB (unoptimized)
- Formats: JPG only

### Secondary R2 Buckets
**Status**: ⚠️ Audit Required  
**Products Served**: Supabase products, additional inventory

**Known Buckets**:
1. Additional R2 bucket (URL TBD)
2. Legacy bucket (URL TBD)

**Issues**:
- Exact URLs need verification
- Content overlap with primary bucket
- No standardized naming convention

### Cloudflare Cached Images
**Status**: 🔄 Legacy System  
**Products Served**: Older product images, cached content

**Issues**:
- Cache invalidation problems
- Mixed with current R2 content
- No direct upload capability
- Unclear retention policies

### Local/Test Images
**Location**: `/public/temp-images/`, `/public/Swiper-v1/`  
**Status**: 🚨 Development Only  
**Purpose**: Bundle previews, testing

**Current Files**:
```
/public/temp-images/
├── Lavender-main.jpg
├── True-Red-main.webp  
├── black-suit.png
└── [15+ test images]

/public/Swiper-v1/
├── Fall Wedding Bundles/[9 images]
├── Season-1-bundles/[25+ images] 
├── Spring Wedding Bundles/[3 images]
├── Summer Wedding Bundles/[5 images]
├── Tuxedo-Bundles/[5 images]
└── casual-bundles/[15+ images]
```

| **WebP** | 10% | 100-400KB | Excellent | ✅ Optimized |
| **PNG** | 5% | 500KB-2MB | High | 🚨 Too Large |

### CDN Performance Analysis

**Primary R2 Bucket**:
```yaml
Average Load Time: 1.2s
Geographic Coverage: Global
Cache Hit Rate: 95%
Monthly Bandwidth: ~500GB
Cost: $15-25/month
```

**Cloudflare Integration**:
```yaml
Cache Duration: 24 hours
Compression: Enabled

## 🚨 Critical Issues

### High Priority

1. **Image Source Fragmentation**
   - Products loading from 3+ different domains
   - Inconsistent CORS policies
   - Cache invalidation conflicts

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - No WebP conversion pipeline
   - Missing image optimization
   - Large file sizes for mobile

3. **Management Complexity**
   - No centralized image upload system
   - Manual file organization
   - No backup strategy

### Medium Priority
