# Webhook Architecture Decision

## Current Setup
- **Frontend Webhook (Supabase)**: `https://qvcswiimsaxvyfqxbklbz.supabase.co` ✅ Working
- **Backend Webhook (Railway)**: `https://kct-ecommerce-admin-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/stripe` ❌ Signature error

## Recommended Approach: Keep Both Webhooks

### Why Two Webhooks Makes Sense

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - **Frontend/Supabase Webhook**: Handle customer-facing operations
     - Create orders in Supabase
     - Send order confirmation emails
     - Update customer profiles
     - Track customer analytics
   
   - **Backend/Railway Webhook**: Handle admin/business operations
     - Update inventory levels
     - Sync with accounting systems
     - Generate reports
     - Handle refunds/returns processing

2. **Reliability**
   - If one system goes down, the other still processes events
   - Each system handles only what it needs
   - Easier to debug issues

3. **Performance**
   - Each webhook processes only relevant events
   - Faster response times
   - No single point of failure

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Backend Webhook (Immediate)
1. Update the Railway webhook secret to match Stripe
2. Keep both webhooks running

### Phase 2: Optimize Event Handling
Configure each webhook to only receive relevant events:

**Supabase Webhook Events:**
- `checkout.session.completed`
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `customer.created`
- `customer.updated`

**Railway Backend Events:**
- `charge.refunded`
- `refund.created`
- `product.updated`
- `payment_intent.payment_failed`
- Inventory-related events

### Phase 3: Connect Systems (Future)
Once Supabase and Railway backend are connected:
- Supabase creates the order
- Notifies Railway backend via API
- Railway backend updates inventory
- Both systems stay in sync

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Maintains Core Products Approach** ✅
   - Railway backend still manages products
   - Supabase handles orders/customers
   - Clear separation of responsibilities

2. **Scalability** 
   - Can add more webhooks for other services
   - Each service handles its own concerns

3. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Update each system independently
   - Test webhooks separately
   - Debug issues more easily

## Example Flow

```
Customer Purchase → Stripe Charge
                    ↓
        ┌───────────┴───────────┐
        ↓                       ↓
Supabase Webhook          Railway Webhook
- Create order            - Update inventory
- Email customer          - Sync accounting
- Update profile          - Analytics
```

## Conclusion
Keep both webhooks. Fix the Railway webhook signature issue now, and they'll work together perfectly.
