# Agent System Triggers & Activation

## What Triggers the Agents?

The autonomous agent system can be triggered in several ways:

### 1. **Scheduled Intervals** (Primary Trigger)
Each agent runs on its own schedule:
- **Marketing Analytics & SEO**: Every 30 minutes
- **UI/UX Frontend**: Every 60 minutes (8 AM - 10 PM)
- **E-Commerce Operations**: Every 15 minutes (24/7)
- **Product & Inventory**: Every 30 minutes (24/7)
- **Customer Experience**: Every 45 minutes (7 AM - 11 PM)

### 2. **Manual Activation**
- **Admin Dashboard**: Navigate to `/admin/agents` and click "Start System"
- **API Call**: `POST /api/agents` with `{ "action": "start" }`
- **Direct Code**: `await agentSystem.start()`

### 3. **Event-Based Triggers**
Agents can be triggered by specific events:
- High cart abandonment rate detected
- Low inventory levels
- Performance degradation
- Customer complaints spike
- Conversion rate drops

### 4. **Inter-Agent Communication**
Agents can trigger each other:
- Marketing agent detects SEO issue → Triggers UI/UX agent
- Inventory agent detects stockout → Triggers E-Commerce agent
- Customer agent detects issues → Triggers Marketing agent

## How It Works

1. **Environment Analysis**
   - Each agent continuously analyzes its domain
   - Identifies issues and opportunities
   - Creates tasks based on findings

2. **Task Execution**
   - Orchestrator distributes tasks
   - Agents execute within their capabilities
   - Results are logged and monitored

3. **Decision Making**
   - Agents make decisions with confidence scores
   - Critical decisions require approval
   - All decisions are logged for audit

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Low Stock Alert
```
1. Product Inventory Agent detects low stock
2. Creates "stock-alert" task
3. Sends notification to procurement
4. Updates product availability
5. Triggers E-Commerce Agent to adjust promotions
```

### Scenario 2: Poor Page Performance
```
1. UI/UX Agent detects slow page load
2. Creates "performance-optimization" task
3. Implements lazy loading
4. Minifies resources
5. Reports improvements to Marketing Agent
```

### Scenario 3: Abandoned Cart Recovery
```
1. E-Commerce Agent detects abandoned carts
2. Creates "abandoned-cart" task
3. Sends recovery emails
4. Tracks recovery rate
5. Updates Customer Experience Agent
```

## Monitoring Agent Activity

To see what agents are doing:
1. Visit `/admin/agents`
2. View real-time status
3. Check recent decisions
4. Monitor task queue

## Manual Task Injection

You can manually create tasks:
```javascript
POST /api/agents
{
  "action": "inject-task",
  "task": {
    "agentRole": "e-commerce-operations",
    "title": "Check holiday promotions",
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```

## Safety Mechanisms

- Agents cannot modify payment processing
- Bulk changes require approval
- All actions are reversible
- System auto-throttles under load
- Critical errors pause agents

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the latest code to Vercel
2. Navigate to `/admin/agents`
3. Click "Start System"
4. Monitor agent activities
5. Review decisions and optimize

The agents will begin working immediately, continuously improving your e-commerce platform!
