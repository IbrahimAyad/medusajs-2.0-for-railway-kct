## System Management

### Starting the System

1. **Via Admin UI**: Navigate to `/admin/agents` and click "Start System"
2. **Via API**: POST to `/api/agents` with `{ "action": "start" }`
3. **Programmatically**: `await agentSystem.start()`

### Monitoring

The admin dashboard at `/admin/agents` provides:
- Real-time agent status
- System health metrics
- Recent agent decisions
- Task queue status
- Performance metrics

### Task Management

Tasks are prioritized as:
- **Critical**: Immediate attention required
- **High**: Important, process within hours
- **Medium**: Standard priority
- **Low**: Background improvements

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel:

```env
# Google Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Facebook
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_APP_ID=600272069409397
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID=1409898642574301
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_API_VERSION=v22.0
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_CLIENT_TOKEN=f296cad6d16fbf985116e940d41ea51d
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_DATASET_ID=283546658844002
```

## Security Considerations

- Agents respect privacy settings
- Cannot access payment data directly
- Require approval for bulk changes
- All decisions are logged for audit
- Critical changes require human approval

## Performance Impact

The agent system is designed to be lightweight:
- Async operations to avoid blocking
- Scheduled during appropriate hours
- Resource-aware task execution
- Automatic throttling under high load

## Extending the System

To add a new agent:

1. Create a new class extending `BaseAgent`
2. Implement required methods:
   - `execute(task)`: Process tasks
   - `analyzeEnvironment()`: Identify needed tasks
   - `validateTask(task)`: Verify task ownership
3. Register in `src/lib/agents/index.ts`
4. Update type definitions if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agents not starting**: Check console for errors, verify all environment variables
2. **High system load**: Agents auto-throttle, but can manually pause via admin
3. **Task failures**: Check decision log for error details

### Debugging

Enable verbose logging:
```javascript
agentSystem.setLogLevel('debug');
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check admin dashboard weekly
2. **Decision Review**: Review agent decisions for accuracy
3. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust schedules based on traffic patterns
4. **Feedback Loop**: Use agent insights to improve business processes

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Machine learning for better predictions
- Multi-language support
- Advanced fraud detection
- Social media integration
- Voice of customer analysis
