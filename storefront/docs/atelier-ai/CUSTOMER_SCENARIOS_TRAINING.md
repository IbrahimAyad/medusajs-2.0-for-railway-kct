```typescript
// Recommendation Scoring System
function calculateMatchScore(product, customerQuery) {
  let score = 0.5 // Base score
  
  // Category match (30%)
  if (product.category matches query.category) score += 0.3
  
  // Price range match (20%)
  if (product.price within query.budget) score += 0.2
  
  // Color match (20%)
  if (product.color matches query.colors) score += 0.2
  
  // Occasion fit (15%)
  if (product.occasions includes query.occasion) score += 0.15
  
  // Trending bonus (10%)
  if (product.trending) score += 0.1
  
  // Review score bonus (5%)
  score += (product.rating / 5) * 0.05
  
  return Math.min(score, 1.0)
}
```

### Recommendation Reasons

Generate contextual reasons for each recommendation:

```javascript
const reasons = {
  perfect_match: "This perfectly matches your requirements for {occasion}",
  trending: "This style is trending this season",
  bestseller: "Customer favorite with {review_count} 5-star reviews",
  value: "Exceptional value - premium quality at this price point",
