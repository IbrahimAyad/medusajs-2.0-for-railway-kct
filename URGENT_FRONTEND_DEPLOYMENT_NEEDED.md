# üö® URGENT: FRONTEND NOT DEPLOYED - 100x BUG STILL ACTIVE!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISCOVERY

**THE FRONTEND CHANGES ARE NOT DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION!**

This is why the 100x charging is still happening. The fix is ready but not live on Vercel.

## üî¥ CURRENT SITUATION

1. **Production Frontend**: Still using buggy SDK method
2. **Local Frontend**: Has the fix but not deployed
3. **Result**: $1.00 items still charging as $100.00

## ‚úÖ THE FIX IS READY

**File**: `/storefront/src/lib/data/cart.ts`
**Function**: `initiatePaymentSession`
**Status**: Fixed locally, committed to git

### What the fix does:
- Uses custom endpoint `/store/carts/{id}/payment-session`
- Bypasses Medusa v2 bug
- Sends correct amounts to Stripe (no 100x multiplication)

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI
```bash
cd /Users/ibrahim/Desktop/medusa-railway-setup/storefront
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Find the kct-menswear-medusa-test project
3. Trigger a new deployment
4. Select the latest commit with the fix

### Option 3: Push to GitHub (if connected)
The repository might need to be forked or permissions updated to push changes.

## üìã VERIFICATION STEPS

After deployment:
1. Check for `[STRIPE FIX]` in browser console
2. Verify payment amount shows 100 cents ($1.00)
3. Check Stripe dashboard for correct amount

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES

1. **Every minute without deployment = more 100x charges**
2. **The fix is tested and ready**
3. **Backend custom endpoint is already deployed**
4. **Only frontend deployment is missing**

## üéØ SUMMARY

**Problem**: Frontend fix not deployed to production
**Solution**: Deploy the already-fixed frontend code
**Impact**: Immediate resolution of 100x charging bug
**Action**: Deploy NOW via Vercel

---

**THIS IS THE ONLY REMAINING STEP TO FIX THE 100x BUG!**

The code is fixed. It just needs to be deployed to production.
